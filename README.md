# Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository focuses on exploratory data analysis and includes the following components:

## Computing Central Tendency Indicators

- **Mean and Median**: Calculates the mean and median to understand the central values of the data.

## Calculating Variation Measures

- **Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation**: Computes these measures to assess the spread and variability of the data.
- **Range and Interquartile Range**: Determines the range and interquartile range to understand data dispersion.

## Creating a Box Plot

- **Box Plot with Labeled Whiskers**: Generates a box plot to visualize data distribution, including labeled whiskers for better interpretation.

## Generating a Five-Number Summary

- **Five-Number Summary**: Provides a summary including extreme points and quartiles to describe the distribution of the data.

## Determining Deciles

- **Deciles**: Specifically calculates the 1st and 9th deciles to analyze the data distribution at key points.

## Calculating Skewness and Kurtosis Coefficients

- **Skewness and Kurtosis**: Computes these coefficients to assess the asymmetry and peakness of the data distribution.

## Plotting a Histogram

- **Histogram**: Creates histograms using various binning methods (basic rule, Scottâ€™s rule, Friedman-Diaconis rule), including density estimation and a hypothetical distribution density plot.

## Generating a Q-Q Plot

- **Q-Q Plot**: Generates a Q-Q plot to assess the consistency of the data with a hypothetical distribution.

## Creating a P-P Plot

- **P-P Plot**: Creates a P-P plot to evaluate how well the data fits a hypothetical distribution.

## Applying a Statistical Test

- **Statistical Test**: Applies a statistical test to evaluate the agreement of the data with a hypothetical distribution.
