# Preprocessing-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis


This repository focuses on exploratory data analysis and includes:
1. Computing Central Tendency Indicators: Mean and median.
2. Calculating Variation Measures: Variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, range, and interquartile range.
3. Creating a Box Plot: With labeled whiskers.
4. Generating a Five-Number Summary: Including extreme points and quartiles.
5. Determining Deciles: Specifically, the 1st and 9th deciles.
6. Calculating Skewness and Kurtosis Coefficients.
7. Plotting a Histogram: Using various binning methods (basic rule, Scottâ€™s rule, Friedman-Diaconis rule), including density estimation and a hypothetical distribution density plot.
8. Generating a Q-Q Plot: To assess consistency with a hypothetical distribution.
9. Creating a P-P Plot: To assess consistency with a hypothetical distribution.
10. Applying a Statistical Test: To evaluate agreement with a hypothetical distribution.
